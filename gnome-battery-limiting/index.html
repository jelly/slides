# GNOME Battery charge limits

### From Kernel API to GNOME integration

---

# $ whoami

* Arch Linux Developer
* Red Hat Software Engineer
* Day job Cockpit development (JavaScript / Python / C)
* Contributed three small kernel drivers (iio/input/hid)

<div align="center">
	<img src="img/cockpit-overview.png" />
</div>

???

* Day job I go all the way down the stack from UI => Technical details
* In Cockpit we interact with 100 or more API's

---

# Problem

* Daily use a laptop for development
* By default a battery keeps trickle charging when using in docked mode
* Battery degrades over time

???

---

# Solution

* Set a battery charge threshold
* Implemented in firmware
* Might be controlled by an EC

---

# Solution

* Set a charge threshold at 80%

<div style="margin-left: 40px">
	<img src="img/battery-stop-limit.png" />
</div>

---

# Solution

* Start charging under 60%
* Stop charging at 80%

<div style="margin-left: 40px">
	<img src="img/battery-start-stop-limit.png" />
</div>

???

---

# Solution

* Thinkpads have two knobs for charge control
* Limits usually don't survive a power cycle

```bash
echo 60 > /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/charge_start_threshold
echo 80 > /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/charge_stop_threshold
```

???

* Add systemd unit on boot
* Done?

---

# Existing software

* TLP - cli battery saving utility
* Powerdevil (KDE) - allows setting arbitrary limits
* Other DE's - nothing so far
* Windows - several vendor specific tools exist

???

* solutions available, but not for anything I use

---

# GNOME

* Design issue existed for a few years
* Users want it
* GNOME wants it for TCO (Total Cost of Ownership)

???

* GNOME wants it for, for example Thinkpad's hardware certification to sell Linux laptops (afaik)
* Users want it
* So how should it look like?

---

# GNOME Settings

* User configurable thresholds?
* Vendors?
* Profiles?
   - Travel - 0-100%
   - Balanced - 70-80%
   - Best for battery - 50-60%

---

# GNOME Settings

* Simple switch to enable charge limits
* Multiple profiles confuse users

<div align="center">
	<img src="img/gnome-battery-design.png" />
</div>

---

# UPower

* GNOME uses UPower to make devices available on DBus
* Exports devices from sysfs
* Used to display battery information for mice/laptop/$bluetooth
* Keyboard backlight

???

* Cool what API should it expose?

---


# UPower API

* Expose charge start/end threshold
* Expose battery limit enabled/support
* Method to enable/disable charge limiting
* Configurable via hwdb
* Set CHARGE_LIMIT property on UDEV battery object
* Default 60-80%
	- Allow overriding via hwdb on DMI/battery name for vendors/users

???

* No configuration file

---

# Kernel support

* Usually implemented in drivers/platform/x86 (wmi/acpi/ec)

```C
DEVICE_ATTR_RW(charge_control_end_threshold)

static ssize_t charge_control_end_threshold_store(struct device *device,
				   struct device_attribute *attr,
				   const char *buf, count)

static ssize_t charge_control_end_threshold_show(struct device *device,
				   struct device_attribute *attr,
				   char *buf)
```

---

# Device support

* Supports start/end threshold
	- System76, MSI, Huawei, Lenovo (Thinkpad)
* Only supports end threshold
	- Toshiba, Asus, LG

---

# Device support - LG

* Supports 80% or 100%

```c
    if (value == 100 || value == 80) {
        union acpi_object *r;
```

---

# Device support - Toshiba

* Accepts 0-100 as set values
* Reports either 80% or 100%

```c
charge_control_end_threshold_store()

if (value < 1 || value > 100)
	return -EINVAL;
rval = toshiba_battery_charge_mode_set(toshiba_acpi,
	     			       (value < 90) ? 1 : 0);
```

```c
charge_control_end_threshold_show()

    if (state == 1)
        return sprintf(buf, "80\n");
    else
        return sprintf(buf, "100\n");
```

---

# Device support - Asus

* Supports setting 0-100%
* No support to read out configured state in driver
* According to users, sets a hidden start threshold of end - 2

---

# Device support - conclusion

* Different behaviour per device
* No supported values exported in sysfs
* All reverse engineered

---

# Implementation

* Only supports start/stop thresholds for now
* Writes configured state per battery to it's state dir

???

Some users fully charge and then set a stop threshold

---

# Status

* UPower merge request under review
* GNOME settings merge request under review

# Future work - Kernel API

* Expose supported charge thresholds in sysfs?
* Can't break sysfs API

```bash
$ cat /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/charge_behaviour
[auto] inhibit-charge force-discharge
```

```bash
$ cat /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/charge_control_stop_threshold_supported
60 80
```

???

Something to think about, currently it's undocumented so I should probably send
some documentation patches.

Documentation/admin-guide/laptops/lg-laptop.rst

# Future device support

* Steam deck - not yet mainlined charge_control_end_threshold
* Dell? - supports charge thresholds on some Latitudes in BIOS
	- BIOS settings in /sys/class/firmware-attributes/*
	- No charge\_control\_\*_threshold support
* Microsoft Surface - BIOS setting, likely not accessible

???

* Should the kernel then also expose charge_control attributes and write BIOS settings?

---

# Future work - Framework

* Support charge_control_stop_threshold
* User utility exists to talk to the EC controller
* Needs a kernel diver to do that
* Ideal scenario, add firmware support to set charge_control_start_threshold

---

# Battery calibration support

* Thinkpad's support setting the charge_behaviour in sysfs
* Framework can likely support this
* Calibration
	- Disable charge thresholds
	- Force discharge on AC power
	- Fully charge again
	- Re-calibrates battery attributes (energy_full)

???

* disable charge limits
* force-discharge on AC power
* charge fully
* should reset energy_full attribute
